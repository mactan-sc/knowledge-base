## üíæ Install & Update Problems

#### Launcher hangs during installation
- In Lutris, try setting `Prefer system libraries` to `On` globally before installation. After installation, this can be reset and configured only for Star Citizen if desired.

#### Install button does nothing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Launch Lutris in debug mode (`lutris -d`) and look for a `KeyError: 'contentstatsid'` error.
- If the error is present, check your Lutris version. This is fixed in v0.5.11. https://lutris.net/downloads


#### Library version errors during installation
- If using a rolling release or bleeding edge distro, try toggling `Prefer system libraries` in Lutris to `On`.


#### Lutris error: *Command exited with code 512*
- We suspect this is a Lutris bug and fixes seem inconsistent.
- Try going to Lutris Preferences -> Sources, and toggle either `Lutris` or `Local` and then toggle it back again.
- If you have an old install, try importing that into Lutris.


#### Lutris error: *"Runtime Error('No path can be generated for DXVK because no version information is available.')"*
- If you've just installed Lutris, be sure to launch it once, separately from the Star Citizen install process, to fully populate its runtime and caches.


#### RSI Launcher doesn't auto-update
- [Download](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/download) the latest launcher and install it by selecting `Run EXE inside Wine prefix` in Lutris:  
  ![Screenshot from 2023-05-11 10-33-19](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/assets/3657071/d146e9cc-e0a2-4327-acfb-ba5538ddefe4)



#### Installing Star Citizen on an NTFS-formatted drive
- See: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Using-a-NTFS-disk-with-Linux-and-Windows

***




## üí• Crashes

#### RSI Launcher v1.6.2+ JavaScript error
- For more information, see [CIG's announcement in Spectrum](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/upcoming-launcher-update-for-linux-users/5693728)
- Solution 1:
   - In `System options`, make sure Advanced options is on then enable `CLI mode`
- Solution 2:
  - If this does not fix the problem, revert the above changes and install the latest GloriousEggroll runner, available in our [Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper)


#### Code 3 crash with error: *Star Citizen process exited abnormally (code: 3) : Command failed*
- You are likely missing 32bit drivers. See [32bit Drivers](#-32bit-drivers) below for more information
- Additionally, explicitly set the DXVK device name
  - identify device name using command `vulkaninfo --summary | grep deviceName`
  - set device name with environment variable `DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME=yourdevicenamehere`
- If using the Flatpak Lutris, you may need to resync it with your system after installing the 32bit drivers. Run: `flatpak update`


#### Game immediately crashes after clicking 'Launch'
- Start by checking the Wine output and/or "game.log" file
  
- See [latest news](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#general-news) for information on recent stability issues

- Possible cause: DXVK
  - Make sure DXVK is enabled in Lutris' Runner options.
  - Some people report changing their DXVK version fixes this. Try using our [Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper) to download an async DXVK.
  - Nvidia users, check our [latest news](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#news) and Nvidia troubleshooting section [below](#-nvidia) for gpu driver issues, necessary workarounds, and currently recommended runner/DXVK versions.
  - DXVK installation instructions are available on our wiki [here](Performance-Tuning#dxvk-async).

- Possible cause: Incorrect Vulkan device
  - If you have Intel integrated graphics and see `VK_ICD_FILENAMES="/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/intel_hasvk_icd.x86_64.json` in your log, then change the Vulkan device in Lutris to use your discrete GPU:
    - identify device name using command `vulkaninfo --summary | grep deviceName`
    - set device name with environment variable `DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME=yourdevicenamehere` 

- Possible cause: GPU drivers not working properly
  - If, in your "game.log", you see only `llvmpipe` listed as the working video adapter, your gpu drivers may not be functioning properly.
 
- Possible cause: Out of date flatpak libraries/packages
  - If you are using flatpak and have not run `flatpak update` recently, this should be done regularly to keep everything up to date.

- Possible cause: Phantom joystick
  - Many keyboards and mice can also have a "joystick" part in Linux, which Wine can detect. Unfortunately, Wine may be confused about it, as they are not real joysticks. In this case, the game could crash. Try running the Wine joystick control panel "wine control" (in Lutris: right click -> Joystick configuration) and disable your keyboard and/or mice.
  - This will not affect how your keyboard and mice work in the game.


#### Game crashes after clicking 'Verify'
- Make sure Star Citizen is installed on drive "C:\" Check the "Library Folder" option in the launcher settings:  
![Star Citizen launcher](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/608349808956276737/927652866389340310/Screenshot_from_2022-01-03_14-56-37.png)
- Additionally, make sure the wine prefix is not installed on an NTFS formatted partition.


#### Game crashes with "create_view: Assertion `!((UINT_PTR)base & page_mask)' failed."
- Make sure you have set your vm.max_map_count as described in the installation section.


#### Game crashes with " 00adntdll:FILE_GetNtStatus Converting errno 12 to STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL "
- Make sure you have set your vm.max_map_count as described in the installation section.


#### Game crashes with "Failed to initialize dependencies" error
- Make sure the `SDL_VIDEODRIVER` environment variable is **NOT** set globally to `wayland` on your system.


#### Game crashes after switching to Vulkan
- If you can't relaunch the game to switch it back to DX11, you can manually delete the file located at `{wine prefix}/drive_c/users/{user}/AppData/Local/Star Citizen/sc-alpha-{version}/GraphicsSettings/GraphicsSettings.json`


#### After playing for a while, game/lutris/wine crash, no errors
  - If there are no errors in your game logs, check your system logs. It may be an Out Of Memory situation. Create a larger [swap file](Performance-Tuning#swap).


#### Game crashes when going to Lorville / ArcCorp or crashes often when launching
- Make sure you followed the guide to install Wine's dependencies and set your vm.max_map_count as described in the installation section.


#### Game crashes on Alt+Tab
- In game settings change display to windowed borderless

***




## üßä Freezes

#### Game hangs at splash screen or black/transparent window after clicking 'Launch'
- Make sure DXVK is enabled in Lutris' Runner options.
- Try changing to a different DXVK version in the Lutris settings.  Alternate DXVKs can be quickly installed using our [LUG Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper).
- Nvidia users, check our [latest news](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#news) for gpu driver issues, necessary workarounds, and currently recommended runner/DXVK versions.
- DXVK installation instructions are available on our wiki [here](Performance-Tuning#dxvk-async).


#### Launcher freezes within a few seconds of opening
- Try using a different runner. Ask on Spectrum or in our social channels which runner is currently recommended.
- Alternatively, you can try changing "Prefer system libraries" to ON, although this may have other side effects.
  - Right click the game -> Configure -> System options -> Prefer system libraries


#### Launch Game stuck at "launching..."
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Launch Lutris in debug mode (`lutris -d`) and look for a `KeyError: 'contentstatsid'` error.
- If the error is present, check your Lutris version. This is fixed in v0.5.11. https://lutris.net/downloads


#### Launcher hangs / stops responding / crashes with an "ASAR" error
- Some people report the launcher hanging in combination with the Lutris runtime. If you are on Lutris, try toggling "Disable Lutris runtime" under "System options" of the Lutris game options.
- If you do need to disable the Lutris runtime, the Lutris guys would like to have a log file to debug the issue. You can run lutris -d from the terminal after enabling Wine debugging as per this image:  
![Enable Wine debugging](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/imager/Xeh-bNe8P9_WE60v7iLpmeXXLzI=/fit-in/400x400/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/540589766811451392/558481590687236096/Peek_2019-03-22_05-43.gif)
- And send a log to @beniwtv on Spectrum or send it to Lutris developers in the Lutris Discord.

## ü§™ Unexpected Behavior (sometimes also crashes)

#### Mouse/Cursor warp issues and view snapping in interaction mode
- The 3.18 update caused mouse and view snapping issues for most Penguins using Wayland + some desktop environments, especially KDE. The simplest workaround is to use Xorg or switch to an alternate desktop environment. For example, most Gnome users don't seem to experience this issue.
  - For some users, switching their runner to Proton Wine >=9 is sufficient to resolve the issue.
  - Alternatively, build xwayland with this [patch](https://github.com/Nobara-Project/rpm-sources/blob/main/baseos/xorg-x11-server-Xwayland/xwayland-pointer-warp-fix.patch) applied.
  - If using KDE and patching xwayland, you will also need to install Gamescope and use the `--force-grab-cursor` option.
- **Note for Nvidia users:** Gamescope may not work on your hardware. See this [known issue report](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/526).
  - A possible fix to get Gamescope working on Nvidia: `Right click the game->Configure->System options->Game execution->Environment variables` then find or create `__GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS` in the left column and change/set it to `0` in the right column.
- After installing Gamescope, enable it in Lutris: `Right click the game->Configure->System options->Gamescope->Enable Gamescope`. Then, set `Output Resolution` to your monitor's native resolution, ie `1920x1080`.
- If you're using a version of gamescope newer than **3.11.51**, an additional Gamescope setting is required. Set `Relative Mouse Mode` to on
- Other Gamescope settings that may be required depending on your system: `Window Mode` set to `Fullscreen` if it doesn't launch fullscreen, `-g` in `Custom Settings` to grab keyboard
- Depending on your system, `Prefer System Libraries` may need to be enabled or disabled in Lutris
- If this doesn't work, you will need to switch to Xorg instead of Wayland.


#### Mouse/Cursor restricted to a region smaller than the display, or clicks offset from cursor
- Create a user.cfg file in the LIVE, PTU, EPTU, TECH-PREVIEW directory
 ```
 Con_Restricted = 0
 #set to your display resolution
 r_width = 3440
 r_height = 1440
 ```


#### Empty launcher
- Log out log back in, or reset the launcher by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R


#### Visual glitches or semi-transparent lines, poor performance, possibly random crashes
- DXVK is likely disabled in Lutris's Runner options. Make sure it is enabled.
- Your game shader cache may need to be cleared. Our [Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper) can quickly clear your game shaders.
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/608349808956276737/1070664567425871960/SC_Lines.jpg)


#### No sound in game
- Depending on your distribution, you may need to set `Prefer System Libraries` in Lutris to `ON`.
- If you have sound in the launcher but not in the game, launch the game and go to your audio settings, then enable "Play sound while game is in background".


#### Anticheat encountered an error (possible code 30033)
- Follow the instructions to make sure the [EAC Workaround](Tips-and-Tricks#easy-anti-cheat-workaround) is applied.
- Check your process list for any lingering wine processes. Reboot if necessary.
- You may have to delete the EAC directory in youre prefix's `AppData/Roaming` directory.
- You may also have to delete the EAC directory in the Star Citizen `LIVE` directory, followed by verifying files in the launcher.


#### Required Vulkan Extensions are missing error / poor performance compared to windows / error code 3
- Check if you have amdvlk installed by running `vulkaninfo --summary`. The vulkaninfo utility is part of the package `vulkan-tools` on most distros. You can also check your package manager.
- If your system is using amdvlk, uninstall that package and replace it with `vulkan-radeon`.
- For additional help with this, ask in our [Discord](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#welcome-space-penguins) tech support channel.


#### DirectX error message
- Error may read "Star Citizen requires DirectX feature level of 11.1 as a minimum which is not supported at present on this machine"  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3657071/224719841-ba1e831b-4ace-4f14-b423-3e49528154c6.png)
- Check that the `Vulkan device` is not set to an integrated gpu (ie, Intel)
  - identify device name using command `vulkaninfo --summary | grep deviceName`
  - set device name with environment variable `DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME=yourdevicenamehere`
  - verify by setting environment variable `DXVK_HUD=1` and observing the device name in the upper left of the screen
- Also make sure your GPU drivers (Mesa/nvidia) are up to date and DXVK is enabled/updated.


#### Failed to initialize dependencies error
- Make sure the `SDL_VIDEODRIVER` environment variable is **NOT** set globally to `wayland` on your system. This causes incompatibilities with many games. If it is, simply unset it.


#### Black or flickering window, possible crash with errors 15006 or 30007
- Check for larger resolutions and scaling settings.  See CIG's [support article](https://support.robertsspaceindustries.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000081887-Guide-to-Graphic-Issues#large-res)


#### Black/transparent window after clicking 'Launch'
- Check our [latest news](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#news) for gpu driver issues, necessary workarounds, and currently recommended runner/DXVK versions.
- Make sure DXVK is enabled in Lutris' Runner options.
- Try changing to a different DXVK version in the Lutris settings.  Alternate DXVKs can be quickly installed using our [LUG Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper).
- DXVK installation instructions are available on our wiki [here](Performance-Tuning#dxvk-async).


#### RSI Launcher white screen / error DCompositionCreateDevice
- In Lutris, configure Star Citizen (right-click->Configure->Game options) and add `"--use-gl=osmesa"` to the Arguments field.
- If launching manually: `wine "RSI Launcher.exe" "--use-gl=osmesa"`


#### Crash or black screen while using Vulkan beta renderer
- Check the [latest news](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#news) recommendations for your graphics card
- Revert to DX11: Delete the AppData Local Star Citizen directory inside the wine prefix `drive_c/users/$USER/AppData/Local/Star Citizen/`
 

#### RSI Launcher fails to launch from lutris with CLI mode enabled
- Error message may be similar to `/usr/bin/gnome-terminal.real: symbol lookup error: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libatk-bridge-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: atk_component_scroll_to`
- Disable the lutris runtime in lutris global preferences to work around this error

## üíö Nvidia

#### Current known issues
- See the Nvidia section of our [latest news](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#news) for the ways in which Nvidia is being special today.

#### Crash when taking shield damage in-game
- There is a shield rendering bug that causes the game to crash. It seems to affect 1000 series cards.
- There is currently no known workaround other than switching cards. We recommend AMD.

#### Popup saying your Nvidia graphics driver is out of date
- Use dxvk version 2.4+

#### Game fails to start after clicking Launch Game on laptops with Nvidia GPU + intel graphics
- Errors may include `DXVAVDA fatal error: could not LoadLibrary: msvproc.dll` or `Major opcode of failed request:  156 (NV-GLX)`
- Try removing all optimus/prime env vars for render offload and set the Vulkan device to the Nvidia GPU.
  - identify device name using command `vulkaninfo --summary | grep deviceName`
  - set device name with environment variable `DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME=yourdevicenamehere`

#### Severe frame drops
- Some Penguins are seeing VRAM exhaustion problems on nvidia cards. It appears to be driver related and does not seem to affect AMD cards.
- A workaround that some Penguins have had some success with:
   - Create a new `dxvk.conf` file and add `d3d11.cachedDynamicResources = "a"` to it, then either export `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE=path/to/dxvk.conf` or, if using Lutris, add `DXVK_CONFIG_FILE` as a new environment variable in the game's settings and set it to the file path.
   - If you still have issues or are running applications like OBS, you may also have to limit the vram the game sees to free up some vram for other applications:
     `dxgi.maxDeviceMemory = 6144`

#### DLSS(Deep Learning Super Sampling) / Vulkan
- There is a [memory allocation issue with LibCUDA](https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/issues/174#issuecomment-2227462795), where it attempts to allocate in a specific area already occupied by the game.
   - A possible solution would be patching LibCUDA file increasing this area.
      - Locate your 64-bit `libcuda.so` (usually `/usr/lib` or run `whereis libcuda.so`).
      - Generate `libcuda.patched.so` with:  
        ```
        echo -ne $(od -An -tx1 -v /path/to/libcuda.so | tr -d '\n' | sed -e 's/00 00 00 f8 ff 00 00 00/00 00 00 f8 ff ff 00 00/g' -e 's/ /\\x/g') > libcuda.patched.so
        ```
      - Use the environment variable `LD_PRELOAD` to load the patched version:  
       `LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/the/libcuda.patched.so:$LD_PRELOAD`
      - Remove the `WINE_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU` env variable if it is set in Lutris or your launch script.
      - Don't forget to enable DXVK-NVAPI.
